Revision history for Perl extension Business::Associates.

      CPAN upload

0.97: Oops, the 0.96 version did not include Makefile.PL. My apologies!! Now you should be able to do:

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
% make install

      to install.

0.96: Release candidate. All the Documentation now references OK and is up-to-date with the latest changes. Includes meaningful tests for make test and suppression of a debug statement.

0.91: Please see the updated Main Associates Documentation for installation, quick start guides, and documentation. Note that the remaining documentation is not up-to-date (but close...).

0.90: Now includes makefile and installation script, and package is renamed to Business::Associates.
